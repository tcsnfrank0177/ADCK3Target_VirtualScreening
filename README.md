All computational files and technique details are available in the uploaded files. Initial molecular docking calculations, based on the 5I35 protein structure (with pharmacophore definition by MOE and docking conducted via AutoDock Vina), were performed using in-house libraries containing SMILES files, including GENESIS, NPACT, and SYTRAVON (uploaded for reference). Experimental details and data on active compounds are confidential and available upon request. IC50 values and efficacy serve as the primary metrics for selecting candidate compounds. The top-ranking compounds underwent further analysis using the MOE package with respect to the defined pharmacophore. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of drug compounds NCGC00440171, NCGC00122705, NCGC00116016, NCGC00119692, NCGC00262195, and NCGC00117632 were conducted using Gromacs2019 (related files uploaded for reference; a simulation duration of 100 ns with a time step of 2fs is recommended). Considering computational costs, we recommend utilizing AutoDock for large-scale docking calculations and MOE for re-analysis of top compounds.
